# restaurantManagement
restaurant management back-end API

(feel free to add to this Heath)

//TODO:
1- Finish building entities, repos, controllers, & services. 
  -Should be done by tuesday 4/6 ideally, leaving us 2 full weeks to test/bug fix and implement log-in. Also gives us time to bring it to Ken if we've made a mess of it.
  -Here's what's left: (ProductController, ReviewController, UserController, ProductService, ReviewService, UserService, Potential Utils: restaurant review/ avg review score per restaurant....etc.)
    -May need git ignore file. Currently doesn't seeem to be an issue
    -may need to clean up the github. Looks like we might have a couple of entity files, and that's probably my fault

2- Go thru and make sure we have the correct annotations to build the DB. Test overall CRUD functionality

3 - Need a log-in(authorization) & JWT system/ Probably gonna have to rewatch some videos and see how to build these extra classes.
