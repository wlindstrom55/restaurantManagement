# restaurantManagement
restaurant management back-end API:

//TODO:
1- Finish building entities, repos, controllers, & services. 
  -Here's what's left: ( Rservation Service/Controller & Potential Utils: restaurant review/ avg review score per restaurant....etc.)
  
2- Go thru and make sure we have the correct annotations to build the DB. Test overall CRUD functionality

3 - Need a log-in(authorization) & JWT system/ Probably gonna have to rewatch some videos and see how to build these extra classes.
